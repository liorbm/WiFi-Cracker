# WiFi-Cracker

A powerful and user-friendly tool for capturing WPA/WPA2 handshakes and cracking WiFi passwords. This tool automates the process of network scanning, handshake capture, and password cracking with a beautiful colored interface.

## Features

- üé® Beautiful colored interface with vibrant output
- üì° Automatic wireless interface detection and monitor mode setup
- üîç Network scanning with detailed information display
- ü§ù Automated handshake capture with deauthentication attack
- üîë Multiple password cracking methods:
  - Israeli phone numbers wordlist generation
  - Custom wordlist support
- üñ•Ô∏è Colored xterm windows for real-time monitoring
- üßπ Automatic cleanup of processes.

## Requirements

- Linux-based operating system (preferably Kali Linux)
- Root privileges
- Wireless interface supporting monitor mode
- Required tools:
  - aircrack-ng (includes airodump-ng, aireplay-ng, and airmon-ng)
  - crunch
  - xterm
  - figlet

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/liorbm/WiFi-Cracker.git
cd WiFi-Cracker
```

2. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x WiFi-Cracker.sh
```

## Usage

1. Run the script with root privileges:
```bash
sudo ./WiFi-Cracker.sh
```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions:
   - Select target network from the list
   - Wait for handshake capture
   - Choose password cracking wordlist
   - Wait for results

## Notes

- This tool is for educational purposes only
- Always ensure you have permission to test networks
- The tool requires a compatible wireless interface
- Some features may require additional dependencies
- Kali Linux VM's are using the CPU to run wordlists,
  So - be patient because its slower than a GPU usage.
- To crack a WPA handshake with a GPU, convert the .cap to .hc22000
  and use Hashcat on Windows for better GPU performance and stability
